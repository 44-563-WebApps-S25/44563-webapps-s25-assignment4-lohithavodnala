[Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches.]

In thunder, lightning, or in rain?  

Second Witch: When the hurlyburly’s done,  
When the battle’s lost and won.  

Third Witch: That will be ere the set of sun.  

First Witch: Where the place?  

Second Witch: Upon the heath.  

Third Witch: There to meet with Macbeth.  

First Witch: I come, Graymalkin!  

Second Witch: Paddock calls.

All: Fair is foul, and foul is fair:  
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
